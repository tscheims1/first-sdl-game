The settings below are for version 2.0.2 SDL. If you follow the video it will show you how to set the 
directories correctly.This is just a reference of what needs to be where.

Settings:
Under settingsLinker settings
-lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image

Under: settings>Search directories>Compiler
C:\SDL\SDL2-2.0.2\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2
C:\SDL\SDL2_image-2.0.0\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2

Under: settings>Search directories>Linker
C:\SDL\SDL2-2.0.2\i686-w64-mingw32\lib
C:\SDL\SDL2_image-2.0.0\i686-w64-mingw32\lib

My includes are
#include <SDL.h>
#include <SDL_image.h>

if you change 
C:\SDL\SDL2-2.0.2\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2
C:\SDL\SDL2_image-2.0.0\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2
to
C:\SDL\SDL2-2.0.2\i686-w64-mingw32\include
C:\SDL\SDL2_image-2.0.0\i686-w64-mingw32\include
the include would need to be changed to
#include<SDL2/SDL.h>
#include<SDL2/SDL_image.h>
